#include <iostream>

/*
Pseudocode:
1. Count the frequency that each number appears in the set.
2. Create new array where each index maps to its associated frequency.
3. For each index, add the previos index's value to its own value to get its new value.
4. Shift each index value one to it's right (and set the first index to 0).
5. The resulting array contains the starting index for each index value in the sorted array.
