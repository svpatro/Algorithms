# Algorithms

In each category of algorithms, I have included a `src` folder which contains code files that are common to each of the algorithms (as applicable). 

The following algorithms are implemented:

### Divide & Conquer
- Closest Points
- Counting Sort
- Inversion Counting
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort

### Dynamic Programming
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Fibonacci
- Interval Scheduling
- Maximum Independent Set
- Median of Medians
- Subset Sum

### Graph
- Bellman-Ford
- Dijkstra
- Johnson
- Coloring
- Minimum Spanning Tree

### Greedy
- Fractional Knapsack
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Huffman Coding
